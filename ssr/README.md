# Server-Side Rendering with Next.js üöÄ

## What is SSR?
**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is when the rendering process (converting JavaScript components to HTML) occurs on the **server** before it reaches the client. With SSR, the HTML file you receive is already populated with the content, enhancing performance and user experience.

- **SEO Optimizations**: Enhances search engine visibility as content is available on page load.
